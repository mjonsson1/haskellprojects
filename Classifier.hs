-- (with the -- test flag) even if some functions are left undefined.

--                                          Type Aliases
-- These type aliases help to abstract our code. You will use them extensively in DigitRecognition.hs
--
type PixelImage = [[Bool]] 
-- A pixel image is a two-dimensional list of booleans.
-- False represents an empty pixel, and True a grey or black pixel. Each pixel image will be 28x28.
type Feature = Int
-- Each pixel location is considered a separate feature for classification. Because the image is
-- 28x28, there are 784 total features.
type Digit = Integer
-- Each image is of a specific digit, 0 through 9. To distinguish the labels or guesses from
-- other numbers, we use a type alias.


--                                      Primitive Functions
-- These functions will be used in your implementation of the classifier. Be
-- sure you understand how they are used, but you do not have to understand how they work.
--

--hasFeature checks if an image has a specific feature: i.e. if that pixel is white or blank.
--
--This encapsulates the ugliness of storing images as nested lists. Notice the normally
--forbidden use of !!. This suggests that there should be a better way to handle and process
--images. For the purposes of this project we will accept this.  We can take reassurance that
--lists of length 28 are so short that better storage methods are probably unnecessary.

--outOf wraps around Haskell's built-in Rational data type. Rationals store fractional values
--precisely, with no possibility of underflow. Internally, the numerator and denominator are
--kept as Integers, which have no maximum outside the space limitations of computer memory. You
--will use this function to return an estimated probability.

-- A corpus is an association list between digits and the images that are labeled with that
-- digit. By storing the information this way, we avoid the frequent computation of which images
-- are labeled with which digit. 
type Corpus = [(Digit, [PixelImage])]

-- When we read in the files, we get a list of image-label tuples. It is far more efficient to
-- group the images by their label as a Corpus. buildCorpus takes the list of tuples and
-- separates it into sub-lists for each label. Order does not matter, either of the digits or of
-- the images associated with each digit.
--
-- I suggest a helper function that takes a digit and returns the list of all images labeled with
-- that digit.
--
-- Full Credit - Implementation Details:
--    For full credit, only create entries in the Corpus for digits that actually have associated
--    images. You might need to use the (nub) function, which returns the set version of a list
--    (i.e.  all duplicate elements have been removed). 
--    Your function must still run quickly!
-- Remember: work on full credit after you've completed the core project!
