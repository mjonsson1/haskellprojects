Projects in haskell

These files are unrelated and are missing the template backbone from my professor's testcases. However, they serve as a representation of higher level problem solving for a wide range of problems. Much of this is unpolished, as it was submitted as a work in progress for homeworks.

The files include a bayesian classifier algorithm for analyzing ascii digits,a scrabble game type optimal move selector, a kMeansClustering algorithm for recentering and localizing clustered data points, and most recently a decision tree for classifying mushrooms.
